\title{Problem #2
\maketitle

You and a couple of friends have decided to meet after a class. One of
you keeps suggesting another route that he thinks would be faster, but
most of you don't care. After he brings this up for the third time,
one of you suggests that you each take a different route and see who
gets there first. It turns out that you all get there within a couple
minutes of each other. You conclude that in this case, the total time
taken doesn't really depend on the route you took very much. But it
makes you wonder, how does travel time depend on the path taken, more
generally?
