\title{Lab 0: Average speed, uncertainty, and error bars}

When you're driving along the highway, your car's spedometer tells you
the speed at a given time. Other times, you might care more about how
long it takes you to make the whole trip, with statements like ``I
live 10 minutes away from the University.'' 



\section{Equipment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motorized toy car
\item Meter stick
\item Stopwatch
\end{itemize}

\section{Prediction}

How can you determine whether or not a toy car moves with a constant
velocity?

\section{Warm up questions}
\begin{itemize}

\item If a toy car covers a distance $D_{calibration}$ in a time
  $t_{calibration}$, what is its average speed? 

\item How long would you expect the same toy car to travel a different
  distance? If the car travels with a constant velocity, how should a
  plot of times versus distances look? How do you expect this to be
  different for a car with small variations in its speed?

\end{itemize}


\section{Exploration}

How well does the cart travel across the floor? Do you notice any
apparent changes in velocity? 

How quickly can you start and stop the stopwatch? When the cart
crosses a finish line, how hard is it to tell when it has crossed?
Decide on a way to estimate the uncertainty of your measurements.

\section{Procedure}

Mark a distance on the floor and time the cart travelling from start
to finish. What was the velocity? 

How far does the cart have to travel before you can reliably measure
the time it takes? Decide on several distances at which you plan to
make a measurement, and measure the time it takes the toy car to
travel them. What are the uncertainties (appendix B)?

\section{Analysis}

Plot the times and distances for each of the trials using error bars
(appendix C). 

\section{Conclusion}

How do you interpret the plot you just made? How can you tell whether
or not the car travelled at a roughly constant velocity during this
experiment?
