\title{Lab 1: Average speed and error bars}

When you're driving along the highway, your car's spedometer tells you
the speed at a given time. There are reasons you might want to know
this. Are you going unreasonably fast? Are you past the maximum speed
allowed? Other times, you might care more about how long it takes you
to make the whole trip. Often people talk about distances in
times. ``It takes 8 minutes to walk between Coffman Union and Tate
Lab'' or ``I live 20 minutes away from campus''. If you wanted to know
the actual distance instead, and had a pretty good notion of how fast
you'd been going the whole time, how would you calculate it? If you
don't have a spedometer, how can you figure out how fast you are
going?

\section{Equipment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Motorized toy car
\item Meter stick
\item Stopwatch
\end{itemize}

\section{Prediction}

If you measure a cart to have a certain average speed, how long do you
expect it to take it to travel a different distance? How can you test
whether or not the average velocity is the same for each trial?

\section{Warm up questions}
\begin{itemize}

\item If a toy car covers a distance $D_{calibration}$ in a time
  $t_{calibration}$, what is its average speed? Performing a
  calibration means using one measurement to set the scale for
  others. This calibration is a little different from ones used in
  later labs because it uses a speed instead of a distance.

\item How long would you expect the same toy car to travel a different
  distance $D_1$? Make a table of predicted travel times for a few
  different distances. If you plot the predicted times versus the
  distance covered, what do you expect it to look like for a cart with
  a constant average speed? What if you plotted the predicted time
  versus the actual time instead?

\end{itemize}


\section{Exploration}

Read Appendix C.

How well does the cart travel across the floor? Do you notice any
apparent changes in velocity? 

How quickly can you start and stop the stopwatch? When the cart
crosses a finish line, how hard is it to tell when it has crossed?
Decide on a way to estimate the size of the error bars on your
measurements.

\section{Procedure}

Mark a distance on the floor and time the cart travelling from start
to finish. Record this information in your lab notebook. What was the
velocity? This will be used for your calibration.

Mark off a different distance, and predict how long it will take the
cart to travel this distance. Record your prediction in your lab
notebook, along with any measurements you made. Measure the time it
takes the cart to travel this distance, and add that to your record.

Make a table of several different distances and times (remember to
make a prediction!). 


\section{Analysis}

Plot the predicted times versus the measured times the cart took,
using error bars. Draw a line on the graph to represents the
hypothesis that the car's average speed didn't change with the
distance. 

\section{Conclusion}

How can you tell whether or not your data agreed with this
hypothesis? Did the cart have a roughly constant speed in your
experiment?
